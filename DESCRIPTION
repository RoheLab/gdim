Description: Estimate the graph dimensionality using thecross-validated
    eigenvalues. The cross-validated eigenvalues are estimated by
    splitting a sample graph into two, the training and the test graph.
    The training graph is use to estimate sample eigen eigenvectors, and
    the test graph is use to evaluate the correlation between the sample
    eigenvectors and the eigenspace of the test graph (thus the population
    eigenspace). The test statistics for graph dimensionality follows a
    simple central limit theorem. The p-values are provided for each
    hypothesized graph dimensionality sequentially.
